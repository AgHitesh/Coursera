          <p>
            Aryabhata was born on 476 CE in Pataliputra which is present day Patna, Bihar. He is famous for putting out concepts like lunar eclipse and solar eclipse, rotation of Earth on its axis, reflection of light by moon, value of pi correct to 4 decimal places, circumference of Earth to 99.8 per cent accuracy. His works include the famous Aryabhatiya which he wrote when he was just 23 years old. He influenced other future mathematicians and thinkers like Lalla, Bhaskara I, Brahmagupta, Varahamihira.

        <p>
          Srinivasa Iyengar Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887 in the present day Tamil Nadu, India. He is one of the most recognised Indian mathematicians although he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics. Srinivasa Ramanujan made contributions to the theory of numbers, including pioneering discoveries of the properties of the partition function. His papers were published in English and European journals, and in 1918 he was elected to the Royal Society of London.

        <h3>Satyendranath Bose</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Satyendra Nath Bose was born on January 1, 1894 in Kolkata, India. A renowned Indian physics, he specialised in theoretical physics. He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, providing the foundation for Bose-Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose-Einstein condensate. He was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan in 1954 by the Government of India. The class of particles that obey Bose-Einstein statistics, bosons, was named after Bose.
